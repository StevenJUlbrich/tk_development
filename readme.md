# Tkinter Learning

This repository is dedicated to learning Tkinter, a popular Python GUI toolkit. Tkinter provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphical user interfaces for desktop applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tkinter, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Tkinter is included in the standard Python distribution, so make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Import the Tkinter module: In your Python script, import the Tkinter module using the following line of code:

    ```python
    import tkinter as tk
    ```

3. Create a window: Use the `Tk()` function to create a window object, which will serve as the main window of your application.

    ```python
    window = tk.Tk()
    ```

4. Add widgets: Tkinter provides a wide range of widgets, such as buttons, labels, and entry fields. Use these widgets to build the user interface of your application.

5. Run the application: Call the `mainloop()` method on the window object to start the Tkinter event loop, which handles user interactions and updates the display.

For more detailed information and examples, refer to the official Tkinter documentation: [Tkinter Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
